## Serveless functions with NextJS & ReactJS

When we create front-end applications with React or Next.js we sometimes need to save information in the database or perform operations that only work when linked to a back-end.

In this project I used Vercel's Serverless Functions to save a user's data in MongoDB using ReactJS and Next.js without having to create a back-end from scratch.

## ðŸš€ Getting started

To clone and run the application, you will need to have [Git](https://git-scm.com), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) + [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) installed on your machine. With all programs installed, run the following command lines:


```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/Luthienn1/nextjs-functions

# Access the repository
$ cd nextjs-functions

# Install the dependencies
$ yarn install

# Run application
$ yarn dev
```
